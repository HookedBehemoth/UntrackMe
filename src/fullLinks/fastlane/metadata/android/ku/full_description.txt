UntrackMe once set by default to open Twitter, YouTube and Instagram links will transform them into Nitter, Invidious and Bibliogram links and delegate the action to another app.

It also supports Google Maps links to transform them into OpenStreetMap links or Geo URI.

The app will detect shortened URLs and will display the full URL before visiting the site.

Gohertoya Lite:

- When sharing a Twitter, YouTube or Google Maps link just pick up UntrackMe to transform it before sharing it with another app.
