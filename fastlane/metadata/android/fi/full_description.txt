NitterizeMe once set by default to open Twitter and YouTube links will transform them into Nitter and Invidious links and delegate the action to another app.

It also supports Google Maps links to transform them into OpenStreetMap links or Geo URI.

When sharing a Twitter, YouTube or Google Maps link just pick up NitterizeMe to transform it before sharing it with another app.
